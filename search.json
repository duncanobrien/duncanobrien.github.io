The surveys also identified the likely places these animals live and what predates them.\nI maintained equipment, made multiple day and night dives, and performed underwater SCUBA surveys during this project.\nThe findings of this work are published in Ecology and Evolution."

This implies antisocial behavior rather than asocial.\nThe findings of this work are published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology & Marine Biology."

Traditionally this site was seen as undesirable place, with myths around a kraken and giant eel living inside (possibly due to the agressive nature of some of the octopus)!\nPublic talks, tours, and citizen science supported by the Centre for Ocean Research & Education all helped improve the community’s perception of the lake into one of local pride worthy of protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Seahorse National Park\na) Benthic transects\nb) GIS mapping\nc) BRUV surveys"
