The [Thalassia Experimental Network](https://global.si.edu/projects/thalassia-experimental-network-ten) is a Smithsonian Institute project aiming to identify the impacts of tropicalisation on seagrass functioning.

I contributed to the Eleutheran site of this network by managing the site's data collection and research protocol.

This involved simulating fish herbivory across the seagrass exclusion cages (see Figure 1a) and estimating biomass changes across the varying exclusions.

The project also actively encouraged Bahamians and tourists to help in the data collection. I therefore wrote risk assessments and designed briefings to ensure safe, equitable and high quality data collection practices.
