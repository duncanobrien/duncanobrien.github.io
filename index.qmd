::: {#hero-heading}

I'm an quantitative ecologist at the University of Bristol. I am interested in the sudden collapse of ecosystems and how we can estimate their resilience. My research has appeared in [*Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/), [*Global Change Biology*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652486), [*Marine Biology*](https://link.springer.com/journal/227), and other peer-reviewed journals. I also work with farmers and non-governmental organisations to implement conservation tools. 

More generally, my research focuses on:

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

* Stability and responses of ecosystems
* Interactions between species and their environment
* The practical prediction of tipping points
* Conservation of ecosystem functioning and services

::: 

I am therefore adept in statistics, multiple coding languages (R, Julia, QGIS, Python and SQL), theoretical ecology and conservation ecology.
