::: {#hero-heading}

I'm an quantitative ecologist at the University of Bristol. I am interested in the sudden collapse of ecosystems and how we can estimate their resilience. My research has appeared in *Nature Communications*, *Global Change Biology*, *Marine Biology*, and other peer-reviewed journals. I also work with farmers and non-governmental organisations to implement conservation tools.

I am therefore adept in statistics, multiple coding languages (R, Julia, QGIS, Python and SQL), theoretical ecology and conservation ecology.
